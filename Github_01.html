<p>Climate change has forced countries all over the world such as Somalia, Venezuela, and Guatemala to deal with large scale migration crises. Food insecurity, low to no income for some families, land not being agriculturally viable, and carbon emissions have all occurred as a result of climate change.<br>


<br> The Truman Center hosted a discussion on global migration and climate change at the CUNY Graduate Center amid Climate Week in New York City. The discussion focused on how climate change has served as a driving force of global migration and how countries struggling with these issues must make critical decisions regarding their infrastructures in the near future. <br> 

<br> “There are currently 70 million forcibly displaced people, of which there are about 25 million refugees.” Said Kelly T. Clements, the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees. “85% of the refugees are in the developing world.”<br> 

<br> Venezuela and Syria are the two countries that have dealt with these challenges the most, as they are the largest drivers of displacement according to Clements. A critical issue is that forced displacement drastically cuts life expectancy. The average lifespan of a refugee is 25-years-old, just one generation.<br> 

<br> According to Clements, 4.3 million people have already left Venezuela, and that number is expected to hit 5 million by the end of the year. Columbia has assisted Venezuela by naturalizing 60,000 babies and the rest of Latin America has provided assistance, but support from the rest of the international community has not kept up.<br> 

<br> Agencies face have struggled to deal with the dynamics in which climate change can affect a country. There is slow onset, which Amali Towers, the Founder and Executive Director of Climate Refugees, describes as “a depletion of resources.” There is also sudden onset, which results from natural disasters. <br>

<br> Dina Ionesco, the head of Migration, Environment and Climate Change, suggests that another solution includes “using migration as a solution, like reintegration.” This would include trying to curb carbon emissions by promoting developing countries to choose safer, more eco-friendly solutions when it comes to their infrastructure. Emerging economies are tasked with making crucial decisions on their transportation, energy, water, and sanitation systems. <br> 

<br> “Up to 75% of the investments for infrastructure in the mega cities in Africa and Asia will need to be made by 2030.” Said Minh-Thu Pham, the former executive director for policy at the United Nations Foundation and a refugee from Vietnam. “They are going to have to make big decisions and if they choose the high carbon path, which is most likely, you’re looking at carbon emissions for decades to come.” <br> 

<br> “It’s a really hopeful moment from our perspective right now.” Said Gregory Maniatis, director of the Open Society International Migration Initiative, referencing Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her work with the Green New Deal, and Greta Thunberg, a teenage environmental activist. “We’ve had small actors in the global scheme of things raise up this issue and make it one that everyone’s talking about.”<br>
