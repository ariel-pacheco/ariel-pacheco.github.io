<p> As gun violence has become a topic of national conversation, gun violence has seen a 3% increase since last year.  
<br>


<br> According to NYC Open DATA, there have been 749 shootings this year throughout New York City from January 1st to September 30th. 
<br>

<br>Police officials have attributed the rise in shootings to the illegal drug trade and neighborhood gangs in certain parts of Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens. They also attribute it to the rise in homicides this year as well. New Police Commissioner James O'Neill says that even though there is a slight increase, the totals are still relatively low. 
 <br>


<br>Compared to other major cities, gun violence is relatively low in New York City. Police have made it a focus to crack down on guns, as gun arrests have also seen an increase this year.
<br>

.<br> "It's important that we acknowledge that gun violence is very real issue." Said Shaina Harrison, Program Coordinator for New Yorkers against Gun Violence. "It can spiral out of control if we don't give it the proper attention it needs."
