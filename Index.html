<h1>Is Cycling Getting Any Safer?
</h1>

<p>As New York City deals with the most deaths for cyclists in two decades, tension continues to build between cyclists, the city, and drivers. Cyclists struggle to find bike paths they consider to be a safe option as drivers feel as though cyclists are a nuisance. The city has struggled to find any viable solutions
<br>


<br> Over the past several years, Mayor Bill de Blasio has tried to implement various measures to improve cyclists safety. One of those measures is the idea of protected bike lanes. Protected bike lanes are supposed to be elevated higher off the road, making it harder for cars to access. Still, some bike lanes are not elevated high enough and cars still have easy access into bike routes. This leads to cars illegally parking in the bike lane, making it dangerous for cyclists in what is supposed to be a protected bike lane.

Earlier this year, Mayor Bill de Blasio put out a $58.4 million dollar “Green Wave” plan with the purpose of enhancing bike safety for cyclists around the city. The plan includes adding in new protected bike lanes. There have been 26 cyclists deaths this year up to this point. That is the most in two decades, and more than doubles last year’s total of 10. <br>


<br>
When Mayor de Blasio was elected, he promised to improve the safety for all who share the road. His term began in 2014. Here are the numbers for cyclists injuries and deaths for that year.<br>

Five years later, the numbers have gotten slightly worse in terms of cyclist injuries; but in terms of cyclist deaths, the number has nearly doubled.

<br> “There’s no such thing as a protected bike lane unless vehicles cannot enter the bike lane.” Said Gersh Kuntzman, 54, an editor for StreetsBlogNYC, a site that focuses on important transportation policy developments in a phone interview. “It hasn’t been effective and it is evident in the numbers.”<br>

<br> According to Kuntzman, a lot of the dangers come from commercial vehicles parking on bike lanes. This forces cyclists off the lanes and into traffic, placing them in a precarious position. “It’s a total shitshow”, Says Kuntzman. 

Kuntzman says the Department of Transportation does come up good designs to try and help curb safety concerns, but that the implementation of these designs is where the problem lies.
